# BME680-Datalogger-with-EINK-display
Datalogger with BME680-Sensor, EINK Display, RTC and ÂµSD-Storage

This project features a Arduino based datalogger reading temperature, relative humidity, pressure and IAQ values from a Bosch BME680 sensor. It displays the data at a 2.9 inch waveshare e-ink display using olikraus's u8g2 lib. The data is being synchronized with a DS3231 RTC and stored at a micro SD-Card.

The whole system runs on a adafruit feather M0 board
